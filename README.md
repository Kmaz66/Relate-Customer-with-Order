Relate-Customer-with-Order for Magneto

This extension lets you relate customer with existing order. It works this way: 
1. Customer checks-out as guest from frontend
2. Customer now registers to the site and now ask admin to make that order available in frontend.
3. Admin goes to "Manage Customer" section and simply relates that order
4. Now, customer can have access that order when he/she logs in.
